		<abstract>The majority of research on user technology acceptance, e.g. technology acceptance model, focuses on individual users' beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward technology use. In this paper, we attempt to examine prior research on user technology acceptance from a methodological angle by borrowing Markus and Robey's research framework (1988). We find that prior studies usually take technology imperative perspective, use</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract—Vertical handover decision making is one of key problems in heterogeneous network environment. In IEEE 802.21 standard, a Media Independent Handover (MIH) framework is presented to facilitate handover with measurements and triggers from link layers. However, vertical handover decision making can benefit from the information more than link layers. In this paper, an Enhanced Media Independent Handover (EMIH) framework is</abstract>

		<abstract>Cooperative relaying is accepted as a promising solution to achieve high data rates over large areas in the future 4G wireless system. In this paper, an adaptive cooperative relay selection algorithm (ACRSA) is presented for fixed relay based cellular networks. According to current user density in a certain cell, when two-hop transmission is adopted, ACRSA adapts selectively between two different</abstract>
