		<abstract>Multicast is a key technology that provides efficient data communication among a set of nodes for wireless multi-hop networks. In sensor networks and MANETs, multicast algorithms are designed to be energy efficient and to achieve optimal route discovery among mobile nodes, respectively. However, in wireless mesh networks, which are required to provide high quality service to end users as the</abstract>

Although naive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily detected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing protocols present a greater challenge.

		<abstract>Multimedia applications over wireless mobile net- works become more popular with the increasing deploy- ment of wireless infrastructures. IEEE 802.16 standard has become an emerging technology to support broad- band access and Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time multimedia applications over wireless networks. This paper discusses the path selection problem in IEEE 802.16 mobile multihop relay (MMR) networks where relay</abstract>

		<abstract>In wireless mesh networks, quality-of-service (QoS) support and fair rate allocation are usually considered separately. Fair rate allo- cation frameworks proposed in previous work focus on elastic flows that do not have explicit service quality requirements. Such frame- works may not be applied directly within mesh networks containing real-time flows that have explicit rate and delay requirements. QoS support frameworks</abstract>

		<abstract>We investigate theoretically some properties of variational Bayes approximations based on estimating the mixing coecients of known densities. We show that, with probability 1 as the sample size n grows large, the iterative algorithm for the variational Bayes approximation converges locally to the maximum likelihood estimator at the rate of O(1=n). Moreover, the variational posterior distribution for the pa- rameters</abstract>
